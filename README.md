# DancingLinksSoduko
DancingLinksSoduko is a sudoko solver using dancing links structure. The implementation is in c++. A
ctually ,the code is all c except some input/output function call.
The sudoku.txt is a txt file which is composed of nearly 50000 examples .I get this file from this website: http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00013890/sudokumin.php.
And ,the comments are all in chinese ,sorry for your guys who see these chinese characters frustrating. 
But the function names imply all they would do, so my code is self descriptive /sarcasm.
If anyone who has some problem with this code, i'm willing to offer help.
